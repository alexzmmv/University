Binomial distribution -> 
Binomial model - class of problems in statistics, where the solution resembles the binomials
		- used when there is an expected succes/failure
		- what is the probability of K successes in N repetitions (N tries)
		
!! Practical exam - full solution does not grant full marks, unless there are also comments to explain 
what's going on !!

P(X = k) = (N choose K) * (p ^ K) * ((1-p)  ^ (n-k))

To type the probability density
Discrete probability laws = GRAPH OF POINTS
Continuous probability laws = not necessarily points

cdf - always a continuous function
	- cdf is depedent on the values of X
	- we create the impression of continuity, by lowering the step to a very small one

The probability law
