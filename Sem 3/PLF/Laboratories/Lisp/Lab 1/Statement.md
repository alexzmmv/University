a) Write a function to return the dot product of two vectors. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product 
b) Write a function to return the maximum value of all the numerical atoms of a list, at any level. 
c) All permutations to be replaced by: Write a function to compute the result of an arithmetic expression 
memorised  
in preorder on a stack. Examples: 
(+ 1 3) ==> 4  (1 + 3) 
(+ * 2 4 3) ==> 11  ((2 * 4) + 3) 
(+ * 2 4 - 5 * 2 2) ==> 9  ((2 * 4) + (5 - (2 * 2)) 
d) Write a function to return T if a list has an even number of elements on the first level, and NIL on the 
contrary case, without counting the elements of the list.
